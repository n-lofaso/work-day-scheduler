# work-day-scheduler

## Description
  This is a scheduler for a standard 9-5 work day. It uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript. This application also uses the Day.js api to get data on the time and date. A user can input data into the text area next to the time and use the save button to save the data to the local storage so when the page is refreshed the data saved will still be on the page.
